        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>The head element contains the metadata for my web application.
              Although they are typically not seen by users, they contain important
              information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li> The following metadata tags are used in the head:</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description,
            keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to us.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
        <li>For example, if there are several elements nested inside of a body element,
            those elements are the child elements and the body is the parent element.</li>
        <li>All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the body
            element.</li>
        <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. In semantic HTML
            elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays
            on a webpage.</li>
        <li>However, some elements are not semantic. These non-semantic elements include
            "div", which creates a division in the page, and "span", which creates an
            inline division.</li>
        <li>An "element" refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag,
            whereas tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
        <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 heading tags apply a steadily decreasing font
            to the associated heading name or title as one proceeds down the hierarchy from
            h1 to h6, i.e. from main heading to the various subheadings.</li>
        <li>The "p" element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
        <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the
            webpage. It can contain various attributes, with the "src" attribute being the
            most important. Src = source and typically points to a URL or image file name on
            the local hard drive.</li>
        <li>The "br" element creates a line break.</li>
        <li>Neither img nor br have a closing tag, with their syntax being: < ... />.</li>
        <li>The "a" or anchor element creates links to the same or another webpage for
            additional information, with the "href" attribute pointing to the URL for the link.</li>
        <li>The "main" element holds content.</li>
        <li> The footer element comes at the very end of the webpage, and typically holds
            info relating to the author's name, copyright, site navigation information, and other
            references.</li>
        <li>In the body of the webpage, the following parent-child structure sectional elements
            are used, in descending hierarchical order: header, main, section, div, card... and
            and p, img, a, ul or ol can be inserted anywhere, at any level below the header and h1.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three kinds of styling: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS
            style sheet.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to
              style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are
              less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
          <li>An entire internal stylesheet can be directly embedded in the HTML file by using a style
              element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in
              the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure
              CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the
              page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is
              preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate
              file, which makes design changes easier. When using an external style sheet, we link the file
              using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>How to create an external CSS style sheet for a new project and add it to the coding files:</li>
        </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>From inside my project directory in Git Bash (e.g. prework-study-guide), enter the <command>
              "cd assets", and then enter the command "touch style.css".</li>
            <li>Enter git status to check what Git branch I am on. If it is not the main branch, switch to it
              and then create a new feature branch for development of the CSS style sheet:
              "git status", and then "git checkout main", and then "git checkout -b feature/add-css".</li>
            <li>Then switch to VS Code by entering "code ." in Git Bash. Open the new style.css style sheet
              file in the assets directory of the project code in VS Code. The style sheet may now be created
              here, either ex novo or by copying and pasting an externally sourced style sheet.</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
          <li>A CSS rule in code has the following format: first the selector, such as *, or h1, or section,
            or card, or ul, or ol, or..... Then comes a left curly brace {, then inside the brace we have a
            declaration, composed of a property, a colon, a space, and then a value, and finally a semicolon.
            A right curly brace } closes and completes this individual CSS rule for styling part or all of
            the webpage. Several declarations may be included in one declaration block, i.e. the entire space
            contained between the two curly braces. For visual clarity, when writing the code in the code editor
            (e.g. VS Code), the selector and left curly brace { are written on the first line, then the first
            declaration (i.e. property: value;) are written on the second line, and any additional declarations
            are written one-by-one on successive lines, and then the right curly brace } is entered on the final
            line.</li>
          <li> Two or more selectors may be combined into a single CSS rule as follows: write each selector name,
            then a comma, and then the next name and comma, etc. For example: header, footer. In the coding editor
            write each selector and its comma on a separate line.</li>
          <li> The CSS box model illustrates the paradigm for the parent-child and graphic hierarchy within every
            HTML element. Every HTML element is essentially a box. In fact, it is a set of boxes, with each one
            placed one inside the other. The outermost box is the Margin. The next box is the Border. The third
            box is the Padding. The fourth box is the Content, at the center, and which constitutes the innermost
            box.</li>
          <li>The reason for combining selectors into a single rule is to apply the DRY (DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF)
            coding principle in my coding projects. The DRY principle ensures brevity, simplicity, succinctness,
            elegance, and thus readibility and simplicity, which improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness
            of my coding work. Adherence to the DRY principle is a PARAMOUNT QUALITY AND VIRTUE IN CODING.</li>
          <li>The opposite of the DRY principle is the WET (WE ENJOY TYPING) principle, which features the
            unnecessary repitition of the same coding in several or many different places of the code, unnecessarily
            and even confusingly overburdening it with excess visual and interpretative weight, and possible styling
            or functional conflicts. DRY is good, and WET is bad.</li>
          <li>The style sheet, style.css, is linked to the HTML project coding file, index.html, by adding a meta
            element to the head element of the web page. It goes after the final meta element and before the title
            element in the head. The link element is a tag using the word "link" at the beginning, right after the
            opening left angle bracket. It is followed by the following words and characters exactly as follows:
            rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css". The closing right angle bracket immediately follows the
            closing quotation mark and is attached to that.</li>
          <li>The link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attributespecifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document
            resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>On the command line in Git Bash, ensure that I am on the feature/add-name
              branch so that I can add the changed files in my working directory to the staging area of Git.</li>
            <li>On the command line in Git Bash, enter "git add -A"</li>
            <li>The "add -A" command commits all files in the working branch.</li>
            <li>Then, enter the following command and message: git commit -m "Added code to XYZ file"</li>
            <li>"-m" associates a message with the commit.</li>
            <li>I should then see a message on my command line confirming addition of the new code to my branch.</li>
            <li>Then ensure that my current branch is up to date before opening my pull request. This is done
              by syncing my local branch with the remote branch in Git Hub. Enter the following command in Git Bash:
              git pull origin main</li>
            <li>I should see a command line message more or less like "Already up to date" in response to this action.</li>
            <li>Then push up all of my changes with the following command: git push origin feature/add-name</li>
            <li>Next, directly in Git Hub, navigate to my current project repo. Once there, navigate to the
              feature/add-XYZ branch.</li>
            <li>Once on my Git Hub feature branch page, click on the "Pull Requests" tab on menu row near the top of the window.</li>
            <li>Once on the pull requests page, find and click the green "New pull request" button.</li>
            <li>Next, compare the two branches that I want to merge. The base branch that I want to merge into should come first.
              In my case, that is the main branch. I want to merge my feature/add-XYZ branch, so that is my compare branch.</li>
            <li>Once on the pull request form, give my PR (pull request) a title and a short description of the changes.</li>
            <li>Then click the green "Create pull request button". That will take me to the pull requests page.</li>
            <li>On the next page that appears, find the green "Merge pull request" button. Click on it and also
              click on the "Confirm" button.</li>
            <li>Once I have successfully merged, I will see the message "Pull request successfully merged and closed".
              I may then safely delete the branch.</li>
            <li>At this point, I can reopen my terminal on Git Bash and update my local repository with the new merged-in feature.
              To do so, enter the following commands on my terminal:</li>
            <li>git checkout main</li>
            <li>git pull origin main</li>
            <li>I may then return to my Git Hub project Issues page, find the issue addressed by the just-completed commit-pull-push-merge
               operation and close that issue by clicking on the "Close issue" button.</li>

        <li><b>Arrays</b> and <b>for Loops:</b></li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>An <b>array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are
            typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable
            with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However,
            instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group
            of values.</li>
          <li>For example: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single
            variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of
              information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with
              a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we
              can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.
            This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location
            identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>Each item is assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored in the array.</li>
          <li>If we wanted to access only the triangle, we start with the name of the variable that stores
            the array, which in our case is shapes. Then we add the index of triangle to the end of the
            array name in square brackets, as shown in the following line of code: shapes[0]; </li>
          <li>In order to see this in action, we should log it in the console, using the following line of
              code: console.log(shapes[0]);
          <li>The most efficient way to change all the values in an array is to use loops, of which there
            are several types.</li>
          <li>A <b>for loop</b> uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an
            array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just
            learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>By using a for loop, we can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and
            log them to the console until there are no shapes left.</li>
          <li>In order to use the for loop, we need the shape's index and the array's length.</li>
          <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code
            will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using
            a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length. A for loop contains the following
            three important statements:</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the
            beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index
            of an array is always 0): var x = 0</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the
            length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for
            each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express
            that condition, as shown in the following line of code: x < shapes.length</li>
          <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a
            predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way
            of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following
            line of code: x++</li>
          <li>A for loop starts with "for": for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {// code block} </li>
          <li>Finally, we put the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets.
            In our case, we want each of the items in the shapes array to be logged in the console.
            In place of an actual index number, however, we can add the variable x from our for loop.
            Now, each time the code runs, x will increase by 1 and the next array item will log to the console.
            The following code shows how this is done: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {console.log(shapes[x]); }</li>
