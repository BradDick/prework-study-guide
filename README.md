Berkeley Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Neophytes Like Me

## Description

This Boot Camp Prework Study Guide webpage project began as a highly recommended exercise preparatory to and preceding commencement of the online classes offered by the University of California at Berkeley Extension course "Berkeley Coding Boot Camp", January 30 - July 25, 2023. However, I am completing it only now, in the fourth week of the course. Consequently, I have benefited from better knowledge and firmer comprehension of and greater facility in using the fundamental techniques of several key web design coding languages and tools: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. These constitute the backbone of the Coding Boot Camp course and the core of this guide. The principal reason why I have completed this guide has been to create a handy memorandum for myself, a bona fide how-to-do-it manual for my own use in learning the basic skills taught and used in this Boot Camp, in lieu of the appallingly insufficient time allocated during the online class hours to adequate presentation, explanation, drilling, practice, and testing of my own knowledge and actual ability to pass the course and become a functional coder. I have put into my own words, paraphrased, or even copied verbatim portions of the Berkeley Coding Boot Camp Prework Study Guide manual. That manual is divided into three modules and made available to me, as an enrolled student. on the courses.bootcampspot.com website Dashboard (inaccessible to the general public). While the long, detailed notes presented in this Prework Study Guide might strike the reader as being excessive, they are actually as dry and brief as functionally possible in order to achieve the assigned goals in the prework (and classroom course) exercises. Coding really is complex and time-consuming. The rushed pace and overly ambitious goals set in this course have only made my learning experience here all the more difficult, and gratuitously so. Truly, to learn coding well, the individual student (in this case, myself) absolutely must dedicate an enormous amount of time to reading all the marvelous supporting theoretical and practical application literature and videos provided online by coding experts. On the other hand, when I am in the virtual classroom during our Zoom meeting lessons, I feel like a hapless, clumsy, half-blind and half-crippled hunter carrying a shotgun that tends to misfire while he is chasing after a young, fast hare dashing helter-skelter through the tumbleweeds of a dusty field pockmarked with numerous, and hazardous, gopher holes. I, that hapless hunter, hardly have a chance to understand anything in class. Now, after writing this Prework Study Guide, and continuing to improve it, at least I feel in control outside of class, knowing with a certainty that I can and do understand the basic precepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Those basics are what I have presented here. I very much hope that other beginning coders might draw some hope and inspiration from my story and useful tips on how to execute at least some of the most basic tasks in Web page coding. I wish the best of luck to everyone!

## Table of Contents

This Prework Study Guide is divided into four thematic parts dedicated to each one of the principal tools and languages used to create Web pages, in order:
- HTML (hypertext markup language, used to establish the framework of a web page)
- CSS (cascading style sheets, used to create the visual layout, aesthetic quality, and thus communicative effectivness of the web page user experience)
- Git (i.e. Git Hub, used for version control)
- JavaScript (the language and set of tools used to render web pages interactive with their users)
